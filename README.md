# VoxelHTML
  Hello world ! In this new project i'm going to create a working voxel engine. And the best is that you will be able to create video game on html (for itch.io for example).

## Wath is the current state of the project ?

  For this moment, i'm working on the rendering of the engine. It is not usable but if you want to test it, you can ! Just go to this git hub page [here](https://modandthink.github.io/VoxelHTML/)

## Wath next ?

  I have just finish to implement a DDA algorithm and i'm starting to thinking about implementing octree.

## Sources

  Want to make your own voxel engine or like nerd stuff, here's some sources who can help you :

* **Thes DDA algorithm : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233899848_Efficient_implementation_of_the_3D-DDA_ray_traversal_algorithm_on_GPU_and_its_application_in_radiation_dose_calculation**
* **A good video to understand DDA algorithm and math being it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbSee-XM7WA**
