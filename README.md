# VoxelHTML
  Hello world ! In this new project i'm going to create a working voxel engine. And the best is that you will be able to create video game on html (for itch.io for example).

## Wath is the current state of the project ?

  For this moment, i'm working on the rendering of the engine. It is not usable but if you want to test it, you can ! Just go to this git hub page [here](https://modandthink.github.io/VoxelHTML/)
